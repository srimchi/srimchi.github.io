    <h2> About </h2>
    <p>This is the final project I created with a team of four for our introductory computer science class in my freshman year of college. It is a mini-arcade powered by an Arduino Uno and Adafruit 16x32 RGB Matrix Panel, and can run an implementation of Space Invaders and T-Rex Run (AKA the game that plays on Chrome when there's no internet). Our project was graded based on our performance at the EECS 183 Showcase event, where we present our project to our professors and sponsors ranging from General Motors to JPMorgan Chase.</p>
      <br>
      <h2> Process </h2>
      <p>The basis for us choosing this particular project came from the fact that we wanted to implement something that we could touch physically, and our desire to expand upon what we had learned in class. Although there were some difficulties involved, mainly stemming from the fact that this project involved some electrical engineering (which none of us had experience with) and our inexperience with the Arduino development environment, in retrospect I am quite proud of how the project turned out. As I said before, because this was an intro course, our breadth of knowledge was still elementary. There was a lot of googling involved, and when Google couldn't solve our questions, then we would turn to our instructors for guidance. Many sleepless nights were spent on this project, but the outcome makes it all worth it.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>Looking back at the code now, I realize how much I've grown and how much my knowledge has expanded. Both my coursework and self-study has allowed me to branch my knowledge and find new and interesting workarounds towards problems in my code. I've also realized that a project is never truly "finished". Even now, I believe that I can implement new games such as Frogger or Conway's Game of Life using the existing template I have now. Having this project as my first foray into CS has allowed me to realize the numerous posssibilites that can be generated, just by starting a new project or expanding on an existing one. As I continue to grow as a developer, I hope that my ideas and creations will continue to grow with me as well.
